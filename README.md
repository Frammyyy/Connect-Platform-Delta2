## Project Description
Texas Engineering Interns is a platform designed to bring transparency and simplicity to the process of students finding an engineering internship. This is accomplished by giving student users an easier way to showcase their professional skills and resume, which will cut down on the amount of time repeating the same information across applications. Additionally, companies can use filters to find qualified candidates and are encouraged to reach out to them.
